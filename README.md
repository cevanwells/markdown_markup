GetSimple Markdown Parser
=========================

This plugin will allow you to write your posts in the Markdown markup syntax and have them converted to valid HTML automatically.

As described in the LICENSE.md file, the original Markdown syntax and perl tool were created by [John Gruber](http://daringfireball.net/). John obviously retains the rights to his work and my appreciation for a neat way to write readable and formatted plain text.

As mentioned, the original tool was written in perl. I probably could have made the perl tool work from within a PHP plugin, but there was already an awesome PHP port of the tool by [Michel Fortin](http://michelf.ca/). Thank you!

Since this is my first GetSimple plugin I needed a bit of direction for how to package the plugin. I used the [Creole wiki markup](https://github.com/vurdalakov/creole_markup) plugin as a guide and I am quite happy with the results. Thank you, [vurdalakov](mailto:vurdalakov@gmail.com)
