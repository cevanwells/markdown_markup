# GetSimple Markdown Parser

This plugin will allow you to write your posts in the Markdown markup syntax and have them converted to valid HTML.

## Credit
I did not create the Markdown syntax nor did I write the parser itself. I have only put existing tools together in such a way as to allow them to be useful for the GetSimple community.
